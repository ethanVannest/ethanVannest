Hello!

I am currently a software engineering student at a General Assembly and anticipate to graduate in the late fall. I am currently learning how to be a full stack developer, and looking to collaborate on a multitude of projects. 

Feel free to reach out to me through my email:

ethanvannest@gmail.com

I love to learn as well as take on any challenges that may be thrown my way. I also love to create and make something that you can be proud looking at!
